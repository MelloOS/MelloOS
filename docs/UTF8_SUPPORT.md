# UTF-8 Support in MelloOS

## Overview

MelloOS provides comprehensive UTF-8 support across all system components, including the kernel, terminal emulator, shell, and utilities. This document describes the UTF-8 implementation and verification.

## Locale Configuration

### Default Locale

The system defaults to `LANG=C.UTF-8`, which provides:
- Full UTF-8 character encoding support
- POSIX-compliant behavior
- International character handling

### Supported Locales

- **C.UTF-8** (default): Standard UTF-8 locale
- **th_TH.UTF-8**: Thai language support
- Additional locales can be set via the `LANG` environment variable

### Setting Locale

Users can change the locale using the shell's `export` command:

```bash
export LANG=th_TH.UTF-8
```

## UTF-8 Implementation

### Terminal Emulator (mello-term)

The terminal emulator provides full UTF-8 support through:

1. **UTF-8 Parser** (`utf8.rs`):
   - Parses multi-byte UTF-8 sequences (1-4 bytes)
   - Validates UTF-8 encoding
   - Handles incomplete sequences at buffer boundaries

2. **Character Width Calculation**:
   - Implements wcwidth-like functionality
   - Narrow characters (ASCII, Latin): 1 column
   - Wide characters (CJK): 2 columns
   - Zero-width characters (combining marks): 0 columns

3. **ANSI Escape Sequence Handling**:
   - Correctly processes UTF-8 in ANSI sequences
   - Preserves multi-byte characters during parsing

### Shell (mello-sh)

The shell handles UTF-8 in:

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - `LANG=C.UTF-8` set by default
   - All environment variables support UTF-8 values
   - UTF-8 in variable names and values

2. **Command Line Input**:
   - Reads UTF-8 from stdin
   - Validates UTF-8 sequences
   - Handles backspace with multi-byte characters

3. **Command Arguments**:
   - Passes UTF-8 arguments to child processes
   - Preserves encoding through fork/exec

### Utilities (mellobox)

All utilities support UTF-8:

1. **File Operations**:
   - `ls`: Displays UTF-8 filenames correctly
   - `cat`: Reads and displays UTF-8 content
   - `cp`, `mv`, `rm`: Handle UTF-8 filenames

2. **Text Processing**:
   - `grep`: Matches UTF-8 patterns
   - `echo`: Outputs UTF-8 text
   - All utilities use Rust's native UTF-8 string handling

### Kernel

The kernel provides UTF-8 support through:

1. **System Calls**:
   - Validates UTF-8 in path names
   - Handles UTF-8 in read/write operations
   - Preserves encoding in IPC

2. **PTY Subsystem**:
   - Transparent UTF-8 pass-through
   - No corruption of multi-byte sequences
   - Proper handling at buffer boundaries

## UTF-8 Character Support

### Supported Character Sets

| Character Set | Example | Bytes | Width | Status |
|--------------|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| ASCII | Hello | 1 | 1 | ✓ Full |
| Latin Extended | Café | 1-2 | 1 | ✓ Full |
| Greek | Γειά | 2 | 1 | ✓ Full |
| Cyrillic | Привет | 2 | 1 | ✓ Full |
| Thai | สวัสดี | 3 | 1 | ✓ Full |
| Chinese (CJK) | 你好 | 3 | 2 | ✓ Full |
| Japanese | こんにちは | 3 | 1-2 | ✓ Full |
| Emoji | 🌍 | 4 | 2 | ✓ Full |

### Character Width Handling

The terminal emulator correctly handles character widths:

- **Narrow (1 column)**: ASCII, Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Thai, Japanese Hiragana/Katakana
- **Wide (2 columns)**: CJK ideographs, Japanese Kanji, Emoji
- **Zero-width**: Combining marks, zero-width joiners

## Testing

### Automated Tests

Run the UTF-8 verification test suite:

```bash
./tools/testing/test_utf8_handling.sh
```

This tests:
1. UTF-8 in file names
2. UTF-8 in file content
3. UTF-8 in grep pattern matching
4. UTF-8 at buffer boundaries
5. Wide character handling
6. UTF-8 in environment variables
7. UTF-8 in command arguments
8. Invalid UTF-8 handling
9. Locale settings
10. Terminal emulator UTF-8 support

### Manual Testing

#### Test 1: Display UTF-8 Text

```bash
echo "Hello 世界 สวัสดี 🌍"
```

Expected: All characters display correctly

#### Test 2: Create UTF-8 Filename

```bash
touch test_世界.txt
ls
```

Expected: Filename displays correctly

#### Test 3: Search UTF-8 Content

```bash
echo "สวัสดีชาวโลก" > thai.txt
grep "สวัสดี" thai.txt
```

Expected: Pattern matches correctly

#### Test 4: Wide Character Alignment

```bash
echo "a世b界c"
```

Expected: Characters align properly (世 and 界 take 2 columns each)

## Implementation Details

### UTF-8 Parsing State Machine

The UTF-8 parser uses a state machine to handle multi-byte sequences:

```
State 0 (Start):
  0x00-0x7F → Single byte (ASCII)
  0xC0-0xDF → 2-byte sequence (expect 1 continuation)
  0xE0-0xEF → 3-byte sequence (expect 2 continuations)
  0xF0-0xF7 → 4-byte sequence (expect 3 continuations)

State 1-3 (Continuation):
  0x80-0xBF → Valid continuation byte
  Other → Invalid sequence (reset to State 0)
```

### Buffer Boundary Handling

When a multi-byte UTF-8 sequence spans a buffer boundary:

1. Incomplete bytes are buffered
2. Next read completes the sequence
3. No corruption or splitting occurs

### Error Handling

Invalid UTF-8 sequences are handled gracefully:

- **Terminal**: Displays replacement character (�) or skips
- **Shell**: Returns error for invalid input
- **Utilities**: Use `from_utf8` with error handling

## Performance

UTF-8 handling has minimal performance impact:

- **Parsing**: O(n) single-pass
- **Width calculation**: O(1) lookup table
- **Validation**: Integrated with parsing

## Limitations

Current limitations:

1. **Bidirectional text**: Not yet supported (Arabic, Hebrew)
2. **Complex scripts**: Limited support for Indic scripts with complex shaping
3. **Normalization**: No Unicode normalization (NFC/NFD)
4. **Collation**: No locale-specific sorting

These limitations are planned for future releases.

## Best Practices

### For Users

1. Keep `LANG=C.UTF-8` for best compatibility
2. Use UTF-8 encoding in all text files
3. Test with `test_utf8_handling.sh` after system updates

### For Developers

1. Always use Rust's `String` and `str` types (UTF-8 by default)
2. Use `from_utf8` for validation when reading external data
3. Never split strings at arbitrary byte positions
4. Use character width functions for terminal output
5. Test with multi-byte characters (CJK, Thai, Emoji)
