# SMP Safety Documentation

This document describes the SMP safety measures implemented in MelloOS kernel to ensure correct operation in multi-core environments.

## Overview

Task 11 "Make Phase 4 features SMP-safe" has been completed, ensuring that the syscall infrastructure, IPC system, and all shared data structures are safe for concurrent access from multiple CPU cores.

## Changes Made

### 11.1 Syscall Infrastructure

**File: `kernel/src/sys/syscall.rs`**

- Added comprehensive SMP safety documentation to all syscall handlers
- Verified that syscall dispatcher uses per-object locks (no global lock)
- Documented that `sys_yield()` operates on current core's runqueue via `yield_now()`
- Confirmed task state modifications use proper locking through `get_task_mut()`

**Key Points:**
- No global locks are held across syscalls
- Each syscall handler uses appropriate per-object locks
- Multiple cores can execute syscalls concurrently without contention
- Task state is accessed through per-CPU structures

### 11.2 IPC System

**File: `kernel/src/sys/port.rs`**

- Added SMP safety documentation to Port and PortManager structures
- Documented two-level locking strategy (table lock + per-port locks)
- Verified port queues use spinlocks for protection
- Confirmed cross-core IPC handling with RESCHEDULE_IPI

**Key Points:**
- Per-port locks allow concurrent access to different ports
- Task wakeup uses `enqueue_task()` which automatically sends RESCHEDULE_IPI to remote CPUs
- Preemption is disabled while holding port locks to prevent deadlocks
- Cross-core IPC works correctly: sender on CPU A can wake receiver on CPU B

### 11.3 Lock Ordering Documentation

**New File: `kernel/src/sync/lock_ordering.rs`**

Created comprehensive lock ordering documentation including:

1. **Lock Hierarchy** (outermost to innermost):
   - PORT_MANAGER.table_lock
   - TASK_TABLE
   - SCHED
   - Per-CPU runqueue locks (in CPU ID order)
   - Per-port locks
   - Per-task locks

2. **Lock Ordering Rules**:
   - Rule 1: Global before Per-Object
   - Rule 2: CPU ID Ordering (ascending)
   - Rule 3: Port before Task
   - Rule 4: Preemption Disable
   - Rule 5: No Nested Port Locks

3. **Common Lock Patterns**:
   - Task Creation
   - IPC Send
   - Task Migration

4. **Debug Assertions**:
   - CPU ID ordering verification in `migrate_task()`
   - Global lock tracking (debug builds only)
   - Assertion helpers for lock ordering verification

**Updated Files:**
- `kernel/src/sync/mod.rs` - Added lock_ordering module
- `kernel/src/sched/mod.rs` - Added SMP safety documentation and CPU ID ordering assertion
- `kernel/src/sys/port.rs` - Added SMP safety and lock ordering documentation

## Lock Ordering Verification

The implementation includes debug assertions to verify lock ordering at runtime:

```rust
// In migrate_task():
crate::sync::lock_ordering::assert_cpu_id_order(first_cpu, second_cpu);
```

These assertions are compiled out in release builds for performance, but help catch lock ordering violations during development.

## Testing Recommendations

To verify SMP safety:

1. **Concurrent Syscalls**: Run multiple tasks on different CPUs making syscalls simultaneously
2. **Cross-Core IPC**: Test IPC between tasks on different CPUs
3. **Task Migration**: Verify load balancing doesn't cause deadlocks
4. **Stress Test**: Run 16+ tasks on 4 CPUs for extended periods

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for even better SMP safety:

1. **Lock-Free Data Structures**: Use atomic operations for hot paths
2. **Read-Write Locks**: Allow concurrent readers for read-heavy data structures
3. **Per-CPU Caching**: Cache frequently accessed global data per-CPU
4. **Deadlock Detection**: Runtime deadlock detection in debug builds
5. **Lock Profiling**: Track lock contention and hold times
